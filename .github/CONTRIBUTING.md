# Contributing

zshclock is open-source.
Anyone is free to contribute as much or as little as they like, regardless of experience, technical know-how, or coding ability.
Whether it's a [simple question][question] or [feature request][request] in Discussions, a [pull request][pr] for some awesome code you wrote, or just a plain old [bug report][bug] (or fifty), no contribution is unwelcome.

That being said, zshclock has just a few things for you to keep in mind if you decide to help make it better ♥

## Bug Reports :bug:

### :x: Don't

- Stay silent. If something's a little wonky for you, it's likely pretty wonky for lots of other people too.

- File a bug report for something that's not a bug. [Feature requests][requests] and [questions][questions] have their own dedicated areas.

### :white_check_mark: Do

- Double-check if a bug has [already been reported][bugs] before you open a new issue.

    - Add to the discussion if you experience a duplicate issue, even if it's just a simple :+1: reaction. The more widespread a bug is, the easier it is to squish.

- Be as detailed as possible. Assume I don't know: what happened, what you were doing, what terminal you were using, or what programs you had installed, because despite all evidence to the contrary, I'm not actually a psychic.

- Update your bug report if you find a workaround. Even if it doesn't fix the root issue, it'll likely help anyone else who stumbles upon your report.

## Feature Requests :bulb:

### :x: Don't

- Submit, like, a jabillion requests. Look, as a serial idea-haver, I totally get it, but at the same time, I only have so many things I can work on at once, you know?

- Complain if your request is rejected. There could be any number of reasons why a feature is bad for zshclock.

### :white_check_mark: Do

- Check if someone's [already thought of your awesome idea][requests] before you submit a new request.

    - If they have, add to the discussion! Is your take different? Is there something they haven't considered? We'll never know unless you speak up.

    - If you're feeling extra adventurous, [try taking a crack at the codebase][fork]. Your implementation of a feature doesn't have to be perfect, but requests with code examples or linked PRs are far more likely to be accepted.

## Code Contributions :recycle:

### :x: Don't

- Submit skinny, cosmetic-only pull requests. If all you're changing is whitespace, formatting, and variable names, it'll probably get rejected.

- Add malware to zshclock. I will cry.

### :white_check_mark: Do

- Make your pull requests detailed. Why does it exist? What issue(s) does it address? What is the intended goal of your code? How many ways can I ask the same question without making it obvious?

    - Utilize lots markdown formatting. Headings, links, tables, code examples, use them all.

- Keep your commits logically separated.

    - Don't be afraid of making commits; avoid squashing. A pull request that touches hundreds of lines of code is significantly easier to review across thirty small commits over one enormous one.

    - Give each commit a useful description. What does it change? What does it fix?

- Follow zshclock's [style guide][style]. Code is easier to understand when it's easier to read.

Don't overthink it.
If your contribution is made in good faith and doesn't break anything, in all likelihood it'll be accepted.
zshclock eagerly awaits its next improvement from you ♥
